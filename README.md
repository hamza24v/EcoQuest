# EcoQuest

## Description

EcoQuest is a cutting-edge platform designed to combat climate change through direct action and engagement. We provide an interactive web experience where users can participate in environmental quests—such as recycling bottles or properly disposing of litter—to earn points. These points are visually tracked on an intuitive dashboard, gamifying the pursuit of sustainability.

## Mission

Our mission is to empower individuals to make a tangible impact on the environment through small, actionable tasks. EcoQuest is more than just a website; it's a movement towards a greener future, one quest at a time.

## Technology Stack (MERN)
disclaimer: up for change

- **Frontend**:`React` and state-managed by `Redux`
- **Backend**: `Node.js`
- **Database: `MongoDB`
- **Cloud Deployment**: Will host on `AWS` if proposal to clients goes well.
- **APIs**:  `GraphQL`

## Impact

EcoQuest can be adapted to various institutions to promote eco-friendly practices:

- **Educational Institutions**: Schools can integrate EcoQuest into their curriculum as a long-term project, offering rewards and recognition to students who reach environmental goals.
- **Retail**: Eco-conscious markets can incentivize customers with coupons and discounts when they achieve certain sustainability milestones through our platform.
