# EcoQuest

*Description*:
This project is aimed to provide an innovative solution to climate change. Our goal is to create a user-centric website where users could engage in and complete sustainability-related quests (picking up and recycling 10 bottles, properly disposing of 5 litter items, etc) to earn points, which would be displayed on a dashboard.

*Impact*:
This type of idea can be leveraged by institutions (i.e. schools, eco-friendly markets, etc.) to incentivize their respective user bases. For instance, schools can set a target goal for students to meet and make it a long-term project whereby they are rewarded with gifts if the students meet the goal. Likewise in markets, customers can qualify for coupons and discounts if they meet a target.
